# (simulate) polymerase-based DNA computing
The repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating systems using strand displacing polymerase. Several systems are simulated such as: (a) Autocatalytic amplifier, (b) Consensus network, (c) Rock-paper-scissor oscillator. The paper will be presented at DNA 25 conference in Seattle, US (2019).
